            <b>-music-</b>
            <p>you can use any of my songs in your projects as long as they dont have a "(NP)" in their name. (NOT PUBLIC)* <br>
            ofcourse as i do not copyright my music i cant really stop you from using these NP tracks however i kindly ask you not to use them</p>
            <br>
            
            <b>-games-</b>
            <p>due to the size of unity files i wont be able to upload my games on this website.<br>
            behind the scene files and other files like them however will be uploaded here</p><br>

            <p>general rules on where you can find my games</p>

                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>finished prototypes: my itch.io</p></li>
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>unfinished game builds: google drive <br></p></li>

            <b>[about my projects]</b>
            <p>a small explanation on my workflow:<br>
            unfortunately im not working on my projects full time and as much as i would love to i cant magically finish all my projects in one sitting and im hoping sharing my workflow will help you understand why some projects take time.<br>
            </p><br>

            <p>firstly: priority wise this is where i sit</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <ol id="servicesOrderedList">
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>videos</p></li>
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>games</p></li>
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>music & art<br></p></li>
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>others<br></p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>but when it comes to actual results here is the rate in which things get done from fastest to slowest</p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <ol id="servicesOrderedList">
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>music & art -> a day or two<br></p></li>
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>videos -> months on end without a video</p></li>
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>games -> i rarely ever finish a project</p></li>
                    <li class="orderedListText"><p>others -> too inconsistant to tell<br></p></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>all this goes to show that im inconsistant, and unreliable but (hopefully) that all add to my charm </p>
            <p>well thats all hope you have a happy stay</p>
